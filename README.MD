# About this project

This fun program takes an iTunes **XML** file, pulls out some of the info and converts it into a database. It is my first project using **Python**. Even though it's a tiny program and database,  I think itâ€™s a good way to show my basic knowledge of:

* Python
* Parsing XML files
* SQL/SQLite
* Databases

---
To run this program, simply download idatabase.py and iTunes.xml (or use your own iTunes library.xml file). Open the created iTunes.sqlite  file with SQLite

## Database schema
